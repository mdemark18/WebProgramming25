# Web Programming Project 2025  
**Author:** Miller DeMark  
**Project Name:** Miller's Games  

## Overview
Miller’s Games is a full-stack web application developed as part of a Web Programming course in Spring 2025. The application functions as an online games marketplace, allowing users to browse products, manage accounts, and simulate the process of placing orders.

The site includes a catalog of **17 products**, each with a dedicated product page, and implements core e-commerce functionality such as authentication, cart management, and order history tracking.

## Features
- Dynamic product catalog with individual product pages  
- User registration and authentication system  
- Secure password storage using encryption/hashing  
- Persistent shopping cart system  
- Wishlist functionality  
- Order placement and tracking system  
- User-specific order history  

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Server-side scripting (e.g., PHP / Node.js)  
- **Database:** Relational database (e.g., MySQL / SQLite)  
- **Authentication:** Password hashing and session-based authentication  

## System Architecture
- Client-server architecture  
- Server handles authentication, product data, cart state, and orders  
- Database stores users, products, wishlist items, cart items, and order records  
- Sessions are used to maintain user login state  

## Security Considerations
- Passwords are never stored in plaintext  
- Encrypted or hashed passwords are used for authentication  
- User-specific data is isolated and accessible only to authenticated users  

## Project Objectives
The goal of this project was to demonstrate proficiency in:
- Full-stack web development  
- CRUD operations with a database  
- Secure user authentication  
- State management (sessions, carts, wishlists)  
- Designing a functional, real-world web application  

## Limitations
- Payments are simulated; no real payment processing is implemented  
- Orders do not trigger external fulfillment or email notifications  

## Status
This project was completed for the Spring 2025 Web Programming course and meets all functional requirements outlined in the assignment.
